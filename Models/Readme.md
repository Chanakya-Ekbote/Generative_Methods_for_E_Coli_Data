## Description of the Models

- __GAN_E_Coli.ipynb__ : Is a DCGAN for the E.Coli Bacterial data.

- __Variational_Autoencoder_E_Coli.ipynb__ : Is a variational autoencoder also having a classifier similar to this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06278.pdf).

- __WGAN_E_Coli_Gradient_Penalties.ipynb__ : A WGAN with gradient penalties was created similar to this [paper].(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00028.pdf)
